# GradeCalculator-
This C++ program lets the user enter a student’s name and scores for two tests and a final exam, then calculates a weighted average (30%, 30%, 40%) and assigns a letter grade. Using a struct to store data and a pass-by-reference function to update it, the program outputs the student’s name, average, and letter grade.
